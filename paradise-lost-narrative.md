## Book 1

In the beginning, man's first act of disobedience was to taste the fruit of that Forbidden Tree—a mortal taste that brought death and all our sorrow into the world, along with the loss of Eden's grace. Yet, hope endures that one greater Being, Jesus Christ, may restore us and regain our blissful seat in paradise.

I call upon the heavenly Muse to sing this story, the same divine inspiration that once touched the secret peaks of Oreb and Sinai and inspired Moses, the shepherd who first taught the chosen people. It was Moses who explained how the heavens and Earth rose out of chaos. If the Muse prefers, I will invoke the inspiration of Sion Hill's sacred slopes or the gentle flow of Siloa's brook, near the Oracle of God, to aid my adventurous song.

My intention is to soar above the traditional poetic realms, pursuing themes unattempted in prose or rhyme. I appeal especially to you, Holy Spirit, who values purity and righteousness above all earthly temples. Instruct me, for you know all things, and you were present from the beginning with mighty wings outspread, like a dove brooding over the vast abyss, making it pregnant with creation.

Enlighten what is dark in me, raise what is low, and support my efforts so that I may assert God's eternal providence. Through this great argument, I seek to justify the ways of God to men.

Tell me, for Heaven hides nothing from your view, not even the deep tract of Hell. What cause moved our grandparents, Adam and Eve, who were in such a happy state and so highly favored by Heaven, to fall away from their Creator? Why did they transgress His will for just one restriction when they were lords of the rest of the world? Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?

It was the infernal serpent, Satan, whose guile, stirred up by envy and revenge, deceived the mother of mankind. His pride had cast him out from Heaven, along with his host of rebel angels. With their help, he aspired to set himself in glory above his peers and hoped to have equaled the Most High, if he opposed Him. With ambitious aims, he raised an impious war against the throne and monarchy of God in Heaven, proud in battle, but with vain attempt.

The Almighty Power hurled him headlong, flaming from the ethereal sky, with hideous ruin and combustion, down to bottomless perdition. There he was to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire for daring to defy the Omnipotent to arms.
For nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men, he lay vanquished with his horrid crew, rolling in the fiery gulf, confounded, though immortal. But his doom reserved him for more wrath. Tormented by thoughts of lost happiness and lasting pain, he threw around his baleful eyes, witnessing huge affliction and dismay, mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.

As far as any angel can see, he surveyed the dismal, desolate, and wild dungeon that burned like a great furnace. Yet from those flames came no light, only darkness that could somehow be seen, serving only to reveal sights of woe, regions of sorrow, and mournful shadows where peace and rest can never dwell. Hope never finds its way to this place; only endless torture exists here, along with a fiery deluge fed by ever-burning sulfur, never consumed.

Eternal Justice had prepared such a place for the rebellious. Their prison was ordained in utter darkness, their portion set as far removed from God and the light of Heaven as from the center thrice to the utmost pole. How unlike the place from whence they fell!

There, Satan soon discerned the companions of his fall, overwhelmed with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire. Weltering by his side was one next to him in power and crime, long afterward known in Palestine and named Beelzebub.

To Beelzebub, the arch-enemy, then in Heaven called Satan, boldly broke the horrid silence and thus began to speak.


~

If you are indeed the one I know, how you have fallen! How changed you are from the being who once shone with transcendent brightness in the happy realms of light, outshining myriads of bright beings. If you are he who once joined me in mutual agreement, united in thoughts, counsels, and hopes, and shared the risk in our glorious enterprise, now misery has joined us in equal ruin. Look into what pit we've fallen from such heights! God's thunder has proven so much stronger.

Yet, despite knowing the force of His dire arms, I do not repent or change, though my outward appearance has changed. My fixed mind and high disdain, arising from a sense of injured merit, raised me to contend with the mightiest. I brought along an innumerable force of armed spirits that dared to oppose His reign, preferring me. We opposed His utmost power with our adverse power in a dubious battle on the plains of Heaven, shaking His throne.

What though we have lost the field? All is not lost. We still possess the unconquerable will, the study of revenge, immortal hate, and courage never to submit or yield. We won't be overcome. That glory will never be extorted from me by His wrath or might. To bow and beg for grace, to deify His power—He who so recently doubted His empire because of our force—would be low indeed, an ignominy and shame beneath our downfall.

Since the strength of gods and this celestial substance cannot fail, and since we've learned from this great event and advanced in foresight, we may now resolve with more successful hope to wage an eternal war, irreconcilable, against our grand foe. He now triumphs, and in his excess of joy, he alone holds the tyranny of Heaven.


~

Thus spoke the fallen angel, though in pain, vaunting aloud, but racked with deep despair. His bold comrade soon answered him.

~

O Prince, O Chief of many-throned powers that led the embattled seraphim to war under your guidance, fearless in dreadful deeds, you endangered Heaven's eternal King and put His high supremacy to the test, whether upheld by strength, chance, or fate. Too well I see and regret the dire event that, with sad overthrow and foul defeat, has lost us Heaven. All this mighty host is laid low in horrible destruction, as far as gods and heavenly essences can perish. Yet the mind and spirit remain invincible, and vigor soon returns, though all our glory and happy state are swallowed up in endless misery.

But what if He, our Conqueror, whom I now must believe is Almighty (since no less than such could have overpowered our force), has left us our spirit and strength entire? Perhaps it is so that we may strongly suffer and endure our pains, to satisfy His vengeful wrath. Or perhaps we might serve Him mightily as His slaves by the right of war, whether to work in fire here in the heart of Hell, or to do His errands in the gloomy deep. What can it then avail, though we still feel our strength undiminished and our eternal being, to undergo eternal punishment?

To this, the Arch-fiend replied with swift words.

~

O Fallen Cherub, to be weak is indeed a miserable state, doing or suffering. But to be strong, and with that strength perform only what is beneath our nature, or accept commands that are inglorious, this inflicts even greater misery. And if we suffer, as we must, by our fault, why shouldn't we also headstrong act freely, even against His service? There's no contradiction in His commands nor will. What can be the worst consequence if we refuse to obey Him? Further misery, perhaps, but we can't be more miserable. If we remain faithful to Him, He may still reign in Heaven, and we'll be stuck here. But if we break free, we could reclaim our rightful place, or at the very least, make Him less than Almighty. Our strength is still our own, and our courage, drawn from irrepressible hope, and the memory of how we once were, is undiminished. We'll either win back Heaven or lose it with glory. What can His wrath inflict that we haven't already suffered? And if we're so troubled by our current state, why don't we end it? No law prevents us from ending our lives. Yet I sense in you a determination to live, a reluctance to give up so easily, a desire to fight back, even though you don't know how. Maybe it's that same instinct that prompts me to live on and tell you that we're not defeated, and that the will to overcome our foes isn't dead. But if we choose to live, we must live to fight, or we'll be like slaves, waiting for our master's hand to end our suffering.

~

Thus Satan, addressing his nearest mate, lifted his head above the wave, his eyes ablaze and sparkling, while the rest of his form lay prone on the flood, stretched long and vast, floating many a rood. His bulk was enormous, comparable to the mythical Titans or Earth-born giants who waged war on Jove, such as Briareos or Typhon, or the sea-beast Leviathan, the largest creature God made to swim the ocean's stream. Perhaps slumbering on the foam of Norway's shores, a pilot of some small night-foundered skiff might mistake him for an island, and, as sailors often recount, moor beside him with an anchor fixed in his scaly rind, sheltering under the leeward side while night cloaks the sea and the wished-for morn delays.

So stretched out in immense length, the Arch-fiend lay chained on the burning lake. He would never have risen or lifted his head were it not for the will and high permission of all-ruling Heaven, which left him free to his own dark designs. This freedom allowed him to heap damnation upon himself through repeated crimes, seeking evil against others. In his rage, he came to see how all his malice only served to bring forth infinite goodness, grace, and mercy shown to man, whom he had seduced. But upon himself, treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance were poured.

Suddenly, he reared upright from the pool, his mighty stature causing the flames on either side to be driven backward, sloping their pointing spires and rolling in billows to leave a horrid valley in their midst. Then, with expanded wings, he steered his flight aloft, incumbent on the dusky air that felt an unusual weight until he alighted on dry land. The land seemed as if it ever burned with solid fire, just as the lake did with liquid fire, appearing in hue like a hill torn from Pelorus or the shattered side of thundering Aetna when subterranean winds, fueled with mineral fury, aid the winds, leaving behind a singed bottom, filled with stench and smoke. Such was the resting place found for the soles of his accursed feet. His next mate followed him, both glorying in having escaped the Stygian flood as gods, relying on their own recovered strength, not by the sufferance of supernal power.

~

"Is this the region, this the soil, this the climate?" questioned the forlorn Archangel, his voice echoing in the abyss. "Is this the seat we must forsake Heaven for, trading this mournful gloom for celestial radiance? Let it be so, for He who now commands can dictate what shall be just. Far from Him is best, He whose reason equaled, but force made supreme, above His equals. Farewell, fields of happiness, where joy forever dwells. Hail, horrors, hail! Infernal world, and you, profoundest Hell, welcome your new possessor—one bearing a mind immutable by place or time. The mind itself is a realm, capable of forging Heaven from Hell, or Hell from Heaven. What matters where, if I remain as I am, though lesser than He whom thunder has exalted? Here, at the very least, we may be free. The Almighty did not shape this place in envy and shall not drive us hence. Here we may reign secure, and in my choice, to rule is worth ambition, even in Hell's fiery depths. Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven's lofty halls. But why abandon our faithful comrades, partners in our loss, lying astonished by this forgetful lake? Shall we not summon them to partake in this woeful mansion, or once more, with arms rallied, strive to regain what may yet be won in Heaven, or further relinquished in Hell?"

~

He had scarcely ceased speaking when the superior fiend began to move toward the shore. His ponderous shield, of ethereal temper—massive, large, and round—was cast behind him, hanging on his shoulders like the moon. It was an orb that a Tuscan artist might view at evening through an optic glass, gazing from atop Fesole or in Valdarno, to seek new lands, rivers, or mountains within her spotty globe.

His spear, so immense that the tallest pine hewn on Norwegian hills to serve as the mast of a great admiral would seem but a wand, aided his uneasy steps over the burning marl. Not like those steps on Heaven's azure; the torrid clime smote him sore, vaulted with fire. Yet he endured, until at last, he stood upon the beach of that inflamed sea.

He called to his legions, angelic forms lying entranced, thick as autumnal leaves strewn along the brooks in Vallombrosa. They were like scattered sedge afloat when fierce winds, armed by Orion, vex the Red Sea's coast, waves that once overthrew Busiris and his Memphian chivalry. Abject and lost, they lay thickly strewn, covering the flood, frozen in the amazement of their hideous change.

His call was so loud that the hollow depths of Hell resounded: "Princes, potentates, warriors, the flower of Heaven, once yours, now lost! Can such astonishment seize eternal spirits? Have you chosen this place to repose your wearied virtue? Or in this abject posture have you sworn to adore the conqueror? He beholds cherub and seraph rolling in the flood, scattered and defeated, until his swift pursuers descend to tread us down. Awake, arise, or be forever fallen!"

~

Satan's call to his legions resonated through the depths of Hell, awakening them from their dreadful slumber. They arose, countless and numberless, like a pitchy cloud of locusts summoned by the rod of Moses, a dark swarm that once hung over Pharaoh's realm. Their appearance was a ghastly sight, hovering between layers of fire, their once-glorious forms now marred and twisted.

The landscape itself seemed to respond to their presence, the very brimstone trembling beneath their weight as they landed. They filled the plains, a multitude so vast that it dwarfed even the most fearsome invasions of earthly history.

Among them were figures of notorious fame: Moloch, smeared with the blood of human sacrifice, his name forever linked with the tears of parents; Chemos, the obscene dread of Moab, whose vile rites once led astray the people of Israel; and many others, each bearing the scars of rebellion, their heavenly glory now replaced with infernal horror.

Their faces, though downcast and shadowed by defeat, flickered with a glimmer of joy at the sight of their leader, not entirely lost. They gathered around Satan, who stood tall and imposing, his form still retaining a semblance of archangelic brilliance. Though deep scars of thunder marked his visage, and care weighed heavily on his faded cheek, his eyes sparkled with dauntless courage and a thirst for revenge.

As he prepared to speak, a silence fell, and the ranks of the fallen angels bent in anticipation. Thrice he tried to voice his thoughts, tears welling in his eyes, a sign of an emotion too profound for words. At last, his voice broke through, interwoven with sighs, a speech that would rally his followers and set in motion a new chapter in their dark and tragic story.
