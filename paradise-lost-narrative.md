## Book 1

In the beginning, humanity's initial defiance was the tasting of the forbidden tree's fruit, a mortal taste that ushered death and all our woe into existence, along with the forfeiture of Eden's grace. Yet a glimmer of hope endures that one greater Being, Jesus Christ, may restore us and reclaim our blissful dwelling in paradise.

I summon the heavenly Muse to lend voice to this tale, the same divine spark that once graced the hidden summits of Oreb and Sinai, breathing life into the words of Moses, the shepherd who first guided the chosen seed. It was he, the lawgiver, who revealed the grand mystery of how the heavens and Earth emerged from the swirling chaos. Should the Muse desire, I stand ready to draw inspiration from Sion Hill's sacred slopes or the gentle flow of Siloa's brook, close by the Oracle of God, to fortify my adventurous song.

I aim to rise above familiar poetic horizons, venturing into themes yet uncharted in verse or song. I turn especially to you, Holy Spirit, who cherishes the pure heart and upright intent above all terrestrial shrines. Guide me, for your wisdom encompasses all, and from the dawn of time, you've stretched forth mighty wings, akin to a dove shadowing the boundless void, infusing it with the seeds of creation.

Illuminate the shadowed corners of my soul, elevate what lies humbled, and fortify my endeavors, that I may bear witness to the ceaseless guidance of the Divine. In the unfolding of this weighty discourse, I strive to elucidate and vindicate the pathways of God to the understanding of mankind.

Speak to me, for the vaults of Heaven conceal naught from your gaze, nor does the profound abyss of Hell escape your sight. What unseen hand or whispered word swayed our forebears, Adam and Eve, from their blessed repose? They, who were cradled in joy and graced with favor divine, why did they stray from their Maker's embrace? Why did they breach His sacred command for but a single restraint, when dominion over Earth was theirs? Who was the serpent-tongued tempter that lured them to that wretched rebellion?

It was the infernal serpent, the fallen one, Satan, whose cunning was ignited by envy and revenge, that beguiled the mother of all humanity. His overreaching pride had banished him from Heaven's grace, along with his legion of defiant angels. Aided by their rebellion, he sought to ascend in glory above his celestial brethren, daring to match the Most High, if he but stood in opposition. With aims as lofty as they were doomed, he conjured an unholy war against the sovereign throne and eternal monarchy of God in Heaven, exultant in battle, yet thwarted in ambition.

The Almighty, with resolute force, cast him downward, aflame from the celestial vault, to meet a hideous ruin and combustion in his descent to bottomless damnation. There, in the abyss, he was condemned to dwell, bound in unbreakable adamantine chains and engulfed in penal fires, a fitting chastisement for one who had dared to raise his arms against the Omnipotent.

For a span ninefold the measure of day and night as known to earthly beings, he lay defeated, along with his dreadful retinue, writhing in the fiery chasm, bewildered yet undying. But his fate harbored further wrath. Haunted by memories of forsaken joy and the sting of perpetual agony, he cast his malevolent gaze upon his surroundings, beholding an immense landscape of suffering and despair. Yet within his eyes lingered a fusion of unyielding pride and unswerving hatred.

As far as any angelic eye might reach, he beheld the forlorn, barren, and chaotic abyss, ablaze like a monstrous furnace. Yet from those relentless flames emanated no illumination, only a palpable darkness, somehow visible to the tormented gaze. This somber veil served but to unveil vistas of anguish, realms of unending sorrow, and shades of despair where peace and repose are forever banished. Hope dares not enter this place; only ceaseless agony reigns here, along with a fiery torrent nourished by never-ending sulfur, unquenchable and eternal.

Eternal Justice had fashioned such a realm for those defiant ones. Their prison, a fortress of complete obscurity, was decreed, their lot cast as distant from the Divine and the luminous embrace of Heaven as from the very core of existence thrice to the furthest extremity. O, how disparate the place from whence they were cast down!

There, in the shadowed abyss, Satan quickly recognized the comrades of his downfall, besieged by torrents and tempests of unrelenting fire. Writhing close by his side lay one who stood second only to him in might and iniquity, a figure destined to be known in later times within the lands of Palestine as Beelzebub.

To Beelzebub, the one next in power to the arch-enemy known as Satan in the celestial realms, the bold voice of Satan shattered the dreadful silence, and thus did he begin to speak.

If indeed you are he whom I once knew, O how fallen you appear! How altered from the radiant being who once gleamed with ethereal brilliance in the joyous realms of celestial light, outshining countless luminous entities. If you are indeed the one who stood with me in harmonious accord, conjoined in thought, purpose, and aspiration, who dared to embark on our resplendent quest, now we find that misery has bound us together in symmetrical devastation. Behold the chasm into which we have been cast from such towering eminence! The might of the Divine Thunder has demonstrated its superior strength.

Yet, though now acquainted with the force of His dread arms, I harbor no remorse or alteration, save in my outward form. My resolute mind and towering disdain, birthed from a feeling of wronged worth, elevated me to challenge even the most mighty. I summoned an endless legion of armed spirits, courageous enough to question His dominion, favoring me above Him. Together, we met His supreme might with our opposing strength, waging a fraught battle upon Heaven's vast plains, a conflict so fierce that it trembled His very throne.

What if the field of battle has been lost? Not all is forfeited. Within us still resides the indomitable will, the unending pursuit of vengeance, a hatred that transcends mortality, and a courage that refuses to bow or yield. We shall not be vanquished. Such glory will never be wrested from my grasp by His fury or strength. To kneel and plead for mercy, to exalt His might—He who so lately wavered in His dominion due to our formidable challenge—would indeed be a base act, a disgrace and humiliation beneath even our descent.

Since the might of the divine and this heavenly essence cannot falter, and since wisdom has been gleaned from this momentous event, elevating our foresight, we may now embark with renewed and more promising hope to engage in an unending and implacable war against our most formidable adversary. He who now exults, intoxicated by victory's sweet nectar, holds solitary dominion over Heaven's throne, ruling with unchecked tyranny.

Thus spoke the apostate angel, although in pain, boasting aloud but racked with deep despair. His bold comrade soon answered him.

O Prince, O Leader of the powers enthroned, who guided the battle-ready seraphim to war, unflinching in awe-inspiring deeds, you challenged Heaven's everlasting King and dared to question His towering supremacy, testing if it stood by might, fortune, or destiny. With heavy heart, I discern and lament the grievous outcome that, with mournful defeat and disgraceful ruin, has bereft us of Heaven. This once-mighty host now lies vanquished in dreadful desolation, as far as immortals and celestial beings can fall. Yet our minds and spirits, unbroken and undaunted, endure, and vitality stirs anew within us, even though our splendor and blissful existence are now consumed in ceaseless woe.

But what if He, our Victor, whom I now must acknowledge as Omnipotent (for none but the All-Powerful could have subdued our might), has preserved our spirit and vigor unbroken? Might it be to have us endure our torments with fortitude, to sate His vengeful ire? Or perchance to employ us mightily as His thralls, bound by the laws of conflict, whether to toil amidst the flames in Hell's very core or to carry out His commands in the shadowy abyss? What gain can it be, though our strength remains untamed and our existence eternal, to be subjected to unending punishment?

To this, the Arch-fiend, master of deceit and harbinger of chaos, responded with words both swift and laden with dark intent.
