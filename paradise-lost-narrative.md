## Book 1

Man's first disobedience, a taste of the forbidden tree, unleashed death and despair, distancing us from Eden. In anticipation, we look to a greater Man for restoration. I call upon the Muse, who once whispered atop Oreb and Sinai, guiding the shepherd to narrate the world's emergence from chaos. If Sion Hill or Siloa's brook, by God's oracle, resonates more with you, from there I seek your guidance. With this grand narrative, aiming to tread uncharted terrains, I implore the Holy Spirit, valuing a pure heart over grand temples, to enlighten and elevate me. My purpose is to grasp and articulate God's ways to Man. Reveal the reason our forebears, favored by Heaven, went against their Creator for one prohibition. Who was their tempter? The serpent, filled with envy and thirst for revenge, misled the mother of all. His pride, after being cast out from Heaven with his rebellious kin, aspired to challenge the Most High, scheming against His divine reign.

~

First, tell of the reason, hidden neither from Heaven nor Hell, that swayed our forebears in their blessed state to defy their Maker and go against His single command, even as they ruled the world. Who lured them into this dire betrayal? The cunning serpent, driven by envy and vengeance, deceived humanity's mother. His audacity, having led a rebellion against Heaven with a host of fallen angels, aimed to surpass even the Most High. But his insolent war was in vain, as the Almighty cast him down in a fiery descent to endless ruin. Bound in unyielding chains amidst searing flames, he who dared challenge the Omnipotent suffered. For a duration far surpassing mortal understanding, he and his followers languished in a blazing abyss. Amidst his torment, he's tormented by memories of lost bliss and the looming eternity of pain. He beholds his desolate surroundings, a blazing prison offering only a gloomy illumination, revealing only misery. A realm devoid of peace, where relentless torment persists. This abyss, ever ablaze yet unending, was justice's design for the rebels. Far from Heaven's light, they found their dismal fate. Such a stark contrast to their former glory. Among the fallen, Satan recognizes Beelzebub, his equal in power and wickedness. Breaking the stifling silence, Satan, once a revered figure in Heaven, speaks with audacity.

~

If you are who I think, how you've changed! Once radiant in the realm of light, you outshone countless others. Are you the same ally who shared my hopes and risks in our grand venture? Now we share this dismal fate. Look at the depths we've fallen from. The might of his thunder was unknown until it cast us down. Yet, even transformed and diminished, I don't regret our rebellion. The same resolve that once made me challenge the mightiest remains. Many joined our cause, opposing his rule, leading to a great battle in Heaven that threatened his throne. But even if we lost the battle, we haven't lost everything. My will remains unbroken, fueled by a desire for revenge, eternal enmity, and an unwavering courage. I'll never surrender or admit defeat. He won't strip me of my glory. To kneel and beg for his mercy, after recently challenging his reign, would be a greater shame than our fall. Our divine essence remains intact, and with the knowledge from our past conflict, we can plan our next move with hope. Whether by force or cunning, we'll wage an endless war against our triumphant foe, who now rejoices and rules Heaven.

~

The fallen angel spoke with defiant pride, even as deep despair tormented him. His audacious counterpart quickly responded.

~

"O leader of the mighty, you who bravely led us in war against Heaven's eternal ruler, challenging his supreme authority. The sad outcome is clear — our defeat has cost us Heaven. This vast army lies defeated, but our minds and spirits remain unbroken. Though we've lost our glory and joy, we're now mired in endless suffering. If our conqueror, evidently Almighty, has preserved our spirit and strength, is it merely to endure his wrath? Or might we serve him in some greater capacity? But even with our undiminished strength and eternal existence, what good is it if we're doomed to eternal torment?" To this, the arch-fiend quickly responded.

~

O Fallen Cherub, to be weak is indeed a miserable state, doing or suffering. But to be strong, and with that strength perform only what is beneath our nature, or accept commands that are inglorious, this inflicts even greater misery. And if we suffer, as we must, by our fault, why shouldn't we also headstrong act freely, even against His service? There's no contradiction in His commands nor will. What can be the worst consequence if we refuse to obey Him? Further misery, perhaps, but we can't be more miserable. If we remain faithful to Him, He may still reign in Heaven, and we'll be stuck here. But if we break free, we could reclaim our rightful place, or at the very least, make Him less than Almighty. Our strength is still our own, and our courage, drawn from irrepressible hope, and the memory of how we once were, is undiminished. We'll either win back Heaven or lose it with glory. What can His wrath inflict that we haven't already suffered? And if we're so troubled by our current state, why don't we end it? No law prevents us from ending our lives. Yet I sense in you a determination to live, a reluctance to give up so easily, a desire to fight back, even though you don't know how. Maybe it's that same instinct that prompts me to live on and tell you that we're not defeated, and that the will to overcome our foes isn't dead. But if we choose to live, we must live to fight, or we'll be like slaves, waiting for our master's hand to end our suffering.

~

Thus Satan, addressing his nearest mate, lifted his head above the wave, his eyes ablaze and sparkling, while the rest of his form lay prone on the flood, stretched long and vast, floating many a rood. His bulk was enormous, comparable to the mythical Titans or Earth-born giants who waged war on Jove, such as Briareos or Typhon, or the sea-beast Leviathan, the largest creature God made to swim the ocean's stream. Perhaps slumbering on the foam of Norway's shores, a pilot of some small night-foundered skiff might mistake him for an island, and, as sailors often recount, moor beside him with an anchor fixed in his scaly rind, sheltering under the leeward side while night cloaks the sea and the wished-for morn delays.

So stretched out in immense length, the Arch-fiend lay chained on the burning lake. He would never have risen or lifted his head were it not for the will and high permission of all-ruling Heaven, which left him free to his own dark designs. This freedom allowed him to heap damnation upon himself through repeated crimes, seeking evil against others. In his rage, he came to see how all his malice only served to bring forth infinite goodness, grace, and mercy shown to man, whom he had seduced. But upon himself, treble confusion, wrath, and vengeance were poured.

Suddenly, he reared upright from the pool, his mighty stature causing the flames on either side to be driven backward, sloping their pointing spires and rolling in billows to leave a horrid valley in their midst. Then, with expanded wings, he steered his flight aloft, incumbent on the dusky air that felt an unusual weight until he alighted on dry land. The land seemed as if it ever burned with solid fire, just as the lake did with liquid fire, appearing in hue like a hill torn from Pelorus or the shattered side of thundering Aetna when subterranean winds, fueled with mineral fury, aid the winds, leaving behind a singed bottom, filled with stench and smoke. Such was the resting place found for the soles of his accursed feet. His next mate followed him, both glorying in having escaped the Stygian flood as gods, relying on their own recovered strength, not by the sufferance of supernal power.

~

"Is this the region, this the soil, this the climate?" questioned the forlorn Archangel, his voice echoing in the abyss. "Is this the seat we must forsake Heaven for, trading this mournful gloom for celestial radiance? Let it be so, for He who now commands can dictate what shall be just. Far from Him is best, He whose reason equaled, but force made supreme, above His equals. Farewell, fields of happiness, where joy forever dwells. Hail, horrors, hail! Infernal world, and you, profoundest Hell, welcome your new possessor—one bearing a mind immutable by place or time. The mind itself is a realm, capable of forging Heaven from Hell, or Hell from Heaven. What matters where, if I remain as I am, though lesser than He whom thunder has exalted? Here, at the very least, we may be free. The Almighty did not shape this place in envy and shall not drive us hence. Here we may reign secure, and in my choice, to rule is worth ambition, even in Hell's fiery depths. Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven's lofty halls. But why abandon our faithful comrades, partners in our loss, lying astonished by this forgetful lake? Shall we not summon them to partake in this woeful mansion, or once more, with arms rallied, strive to regain what may yet be won in Heaven, or further relinquished in Hell?"

~

He had scarcely ceased speaking when the superior fiend began to move toward the shore. His ponderous shield, of ethereal temper—massive, large, and round—was cast behind him, hanging on his shoulders like the moon. It was an orb that a Tuscan artist might view at evening through an optic glass, gazing from atop Fesole or in Valdarno, to seek new lands, rivers, or mountains within her spotty globe.

His spear, so immense that the tallest pine hewn on Norwegian hills to serve as the mast of a great admiral would seem but a wand, aided his uneasy steps over the burning marl. Not like those steps on Heaven's azure; the torrid clime smote him sore, vaulted with fire. Yet he endured, until at last, he stood upon the beach of that inflamed sea.

He called to his legions, angelic forms lying entranced, thick as autumnal leaves strewn along the brooks in Vallombrosa. They were like scattered sedge afloat when fierce winds, armed by Orion, vex the Red Sea's coast, waves that once overthrew Busiris and his Memphian chivalry. Abject and lost, they lay thickly strewn, covering the flood, frozen in the amazement of their hideous change.

His call was so loud that the hollow depths of Hell resounded: "Princes, potentates, warriors, the flower of Heaven, once yours, now lost! Can such astonishment seize eternal spirits? Have you chosen this place to repose your wearied virtue? Or in this abject posture have you sworn to adore the conqueror? He beholds cherub and seraph rolling in the flood, scattered and defeated, until his swift pursuers descend to tread us down. Awake, arise, or be forever fallen!"

~

Satan's call to his legions resonated through the depths of Hell, awakening them from their dreadful slumber. They arose, countless and numberless, like a pitchy cloud of locusts summoned by the rod of Moses, a dark swarm that once hung over Pharaoh's realm. Their appearance was a ghastly sight, hovering between layers of fire, their once-glorious forms now marred and twisted.

The landscape itself seemed to respond to their presence, the very brimstone trembling beneath their weight as they landed. They filled the plains, a multitude so vast that it dwarfed even the most fearsome invasions of earthly history.

Among them were figures of notorious fame: Moloch, smeared with the blood of human sacrifice, his name forever linked with the tears of parents; Chemos, the obscene dread of Moab, whose vile rites once led astray the people of Israel; and many others, each bearing the scars of rebellion, their heavenly glory now replaced with infernal horror.

Their faces, though downcast and shadowed by defeat, flickered with a glimmer of joy at the sight of their leader, not entirely lost. They gathered around Satan, who stood tall and imposing, his form still retaining a semblance of archangelic brilliance. Though deep scars of thunder marked his visage, and care weighed heavily on his faded cheek, his eyes sparkled with dauntless courage and a thirst for revenge.

As he prepared to speak, a silence fell, and the ranks of the fallen angels bent in anticipation. Thrice he tried to voice his thoughts, tears welling in his eyes, a sign of an emotion too profound for words. At last, his voice broke through, interwoven with sighs, a speech that would rally his followers and set in motion a new chapter in their dark and tragic story.
