## Book 1

Man's first disobedience, a taste of the forbidden tree, unleashed death and despair, distancing us from Eden. In anticipation, we look to a greater Man for restoration. I call upon the Muse, who once whispered atop Oreb and Sinai, guiding the shepherd to narrate the world's emergence from chaos. If Sion Hill or Siloa's brook, by God's oracle, resonates more with you, from there I seek your guidance. With this grand narrative, aiming to tread uncharted terrains, I implore the Holy Spirit, valuing a pure heart over grand temples, to enlighten and elevate me. My purpose is to grasp and articulate God's ways to Man. Reveal the reason our forebears, favored by Heaven, went against their Creator for one prohibition. Who was their tempter? The serpent, filled with envy and thirst for revenge, misled the mother of all. His pride, after being cast out from Heaven with his rebellious kin, aspired to challenge the Most High, scheming against His divine reign.

~

First, tell of the reason, hidden neither from Heaven nor Hell, that swayed our forebears in their blessed state to defy their Maker and go against His single command, even as they ruled the world. Who lured them into this dire betrayal? The cunning serpent, driven by envy and vengeance, deceived humanity's mother. His audacity, having led a rebellion against Heaven with a host of fallen angels, aimed to surpass even the Most High. But his insolent war was in vain, as the Almighty cast him down in a fiery descent to endless ruin. Bound in unyielding chains amidst searing flames, he who dared challenge the Omnipotent suffered. For a duration far surpassing mortal understanding, he and his followers languished in a blazing abyss. Amidst his torment, he's tormented by memories of lost bliss and the looming eternity of pain. He beholds his desolate surroundings, a blazing prison offering only a gloomy illumination, revealing only misery. A realm devoid of peace, where relentless torment persists. This abyss, ever ablaze yet unending, was justice's design for the rebels. Far from Heaven's light, they found their dismal fate. Such a stark contrast to their former glory. Among the fallen, Satan recognizes Beelzebub, his equal in power and wickedness. Breaking the stifling silence, Satan, once a revered figure in Heaven, speaks with audacity.

~

If you are who I think, how you've changed! Once radiant in the realm of light, you outshone countless others. Are you the same ally who shared my hopes and risks in our grand venture? Now we share this dismal fate. Look at the depths we've fallen from. The might of his thunder was unknown until it cast us down. Yet, even transformed and diminished, I don't regret our rebellion. The same resolve that once made me challenge the mightiest remains. Many joined our cause, opposing his rule, leading to a great battle in Heaven that threatened his throne. But even if we lost the battle, we haven't lost everything. My will remains unbroken, fueled by a desire for revenge, eternal enmity, and an unwavering courage. I'll never surrender or admit defeat. He won't strip me of my glory. To kneel and beg for his mercy, after recently challenging his reign, would be a greater shame than our fall. Our divine essence remains intact, and with the knowledge from our past conflict, we can plan our next move with hope. Whether by force or cunning, we'll wage an endless war against our triumphant foe, who now rejoices and rules Heaven.

~

The fallen angel spoke with defiant pride, even as deep despair tormented him. His audacious counterpart quickly responded.

~

"O leader of the mighty, you who bravely led us in war against Heaven's eternal ruler, challenging his supreme authority. The sad outcome is clear — our defeat has cost us Heaven. This vast army lies defeated, but our minds and spirits remain unbroken. Though we've lost our glory and joy, we're now mired in endless suffering. If our conqueror, evidently Almighty, has preserved our spirit and strength, is it merely to endure his wrath? Or might we serve him in some greater capacity? But even with our undiminished strength and eternal existence, what good is it if we're doomed to eternal torment?" To this, the arch-fiend quickly responded.

~

Fallen cherub, weakness brings misery, whether in action or suffering. Yet, know this: doing good will never be our role. Our sole desire is to act against his will, whom we oppose. If he seeks to create good from our evil, our aim is to subvert that intention. Our goal is to turn any good into a means for evil, to possibly disturb his plans. But observe — he's pulled back his punishing forces to Heaven's gates. The storms and lightning that pursued us have ceased their roaring in the vast depths. We must seize this moment, regardless of our foe's intent. Do you see that desolate plain, dark except for the faint glow of these flames? Let's head there, away from these tumultuous fires, to find some solace. There, we can regroup and plan our next move — how to further defy our enemy, recover from our losses, and overcome this disaster. We'll explore any hope, or if none, any determination from our despair.

~

Satan, head raised above the waters and eyes ablaze, spoke to his closest ally. His vast form sprawled across the expanse, reminiscent of ancient titans or the massive sea creature, Leviathan. Sailors might mistake such a creature for an island, anchoring to its scales. Despite this grandeur, the arch-fiend was bound to the fiery lake. He hadn't moved, except for the allowance of Heaven's overarching will. This freedom was a test, letting him pursue his dark ambitions, seeking harm to others. Yet, his actions only revealed the boundless goodness and mercy of Heaven, especially towards Man, whom Satan had misled. In contrast, Satan only brought more punishment upon himself.

He then rose from the waters, causing the surrounding flames to recede and revealing a daunting valley. With wings spread, he took flight, the air burdened by his presence. Landing on scorched land, it seemed as if the ground itself was aflame, like volcanic eruptions transforming landscapes. Here, Satan found footing. Following him was his comrade, both reveling in their escape from the infernal waters. They attributed their resilience to their strength, dismissing the idea it was by Heaven's grace.

~

Is this our new domain? The lost archangel questioned, contrasting the bleak darkness with Heaven's radiant glow. If this is the replacement for Heaven's splendor, so be it. The one who rules now determines what's right, elevating whom he pleases. We bid farewell to the joyful realms of Heaven and embrace this infernal world. Yet, in this darkness, I retain a mind unchanged by location or time. Our minds can find Heaven in Hell or Hell in Heaven. Our essence remains, regardless of our surroundings. Isn't it better to rule here in Hell than to be subservient in Heaven? But, why have we left our loyal comrades in their dazed state? Shouldn't they share this realm with us? Perhaps we can strategize a return to Heaven or solidify our reign in Hell.

~

Satan spoke, and Beelzebub replied, "O leader of the radiant armies, only the Almighty could have defeated us. Your voice, a beacon of hope in our darkest moments, has always rallied us during fierce battles. If they hear you now, they will find new strength, even though they lie defeated on that burning lake. It's no surprise we're in shock, having fallen from such great heights."

~

Satan, the leading fallen angel, approached the shore. He carried a massive, ethereal shield on his back, so large it resembled the moon in the night sky. His spear was immense, dwarfing the tallest trees. Despite the burning ground under his feet and the intense heat around him, he walked determinedly to the edge of the fiery sea. There, he saw his fallen comrades, strewn about like leaves in autumn, lost and transformed in their new, hellish forms.

Raising his voice, a call that echoed throughout the depths of Hell, he addressed them, "Leaders and warriors, the pride of Heaven, now fallen! Are you so stunned by our fate? Have you chosen to rest here after our battle, or have you surrendered to our conqueror?" He pointed to their scattered weapons and banners, warning them of Heaven's forces that might soon take advantage. "Wake up, stand up, or accept defeat forever."

~

Upon hearing Satan's call, the fallen angels stirred, hastily rising like startled soldiers caught asleep on duty. They felt the pain of their new reality but were quick to obey their leader's commanding voice. Like a vast swarm of locusts summoned by Moses in Egypt, the demons filled the air, only settling down at Satan's signal.

A myriad of banners, resembling a forest of spears and a vast sea of shields, rose, signaling the assembly of the fallen army. They moved gracefully, their steps orchestrated to the soothing sounds of flutes and pipes, masking the pain of the scorched earth beneath them. As they advanced, they presented a formidable front, waiting for their leader's next command.

Satan, standing tall and still exuding an aura of command, surveyed his troops. Though scars from the battle marred his once radiant face, he emanated a fierce and indomitable spirit. The weight of his rebellion and the sight of his once-glorious comrades, now diminished, visibly pained him. Yet, there was a resolve in his eyes, hinting at plans for revenge.

He attempted to address his vast army several times, struggling with his emotions. Finally, weaving words with heartfelt sighs, he began to speak, and all listened in rapt attention.

~

My fellow spirits, unmatched in might except by the Almighty, our rebellion was not without honor, even though we now find ourselves in this grim abyss. Could anyone have foreseen such powerful beings facing defeat? Yet, who believes that we, the mighty hosts banished from Heaven, cannot return and reclaim our rightful place? I can vouch that no different counsel or risk-avoidance on my part could have saved our cause. The one who now rules Heaven seemed invincible, relying on his reputation and tradition. His hidden strength tempted our challenge and led to our downfall. Now, we truly understand his power and ours. We should neither provoke nor fear another direct conflict. Instead, we must strategize, using cunning where force failed. Overcoming by force is only a partial victory.

There are rumors of new worlds he plans to create, populated with beings as favored as we once were. Perhaps our first act should be to explore or even invade these places. This hellish prison cannot bind us forever, and we won't remain hidden in this abyss. We must carefully plan our next move. Peace seems unlikely, and who among us can fathom surrender? So, we are left with war, whether declared or covert.

~

Upon speaking, countless blazing swords, drawn from the powerful Cherubim, surged forth. Their sudden brilliance cast a light throughout the depths of Hell. The rebels, filled with rage against the Highest, clashed their weapons loudly, echoing a challenge that seemed to reach Heaven's very vaults.

~

Nearby stood a hill, its peak emitting fire and smoke, its surface gleaming, suggesting hidden metallic ores within. Soon, a large brigade hurried there, reminiscent of pioneers preparing for a royal encampment. Mammon, a fallen spirit who, even in Heaven, was obsessed with material wealth, led them. In Heaven, he was more captivated by the golden paths than any divine vision. He was the first to inspire men to mine the Earth for hidden treasures.

Quickly, his team mined the hill, extracting golden veins. It should surprise no one that riches exist in Hell, for perhaps this place is most deserving of such curses. Those who boast of human achievements, like the wonders of Babel, should learn that even their greatest works can be easily surpassed by these fallen spirits.

Near the plains, many others worked, extracting and refining metals from the fiery veins. The metals were then poured into molds, akin to wind flowing through an organ's pipes. Soon, a magnificent structure rose from the ground. Its architecture rivalled even the grandest temples on Earth, with golden decorations throughout. It overshadowed the wonders of Babylon or the grandeur of Egypt's pharaohs.

The masses, in admiration, entered this monument, praising both the structure and its architect, Mammon. He was renowned in Heaven for creating towering structures, where esteemed angels once resided. Even in ancient Greece and Italy, tales of his fall from Heaven were shared. They claimed he was cast down by a furious Jupiter, falling for an entire day, landing on the Aegean island of Lemnos. However, this was a mistaken tale; he had fallen much earlier with the rebel angels. All his architectural prowess did not save him from being cast into Hell.

Soon, winged messengers proclaimed a grand council to be held in Pandaemonium, the capital of Satan and his peers. The call went out, and from every corner, the most esteemed demons arrived in droves. The vast hall, reminiscent of a grandiose battlefield, became crowded, the air filled with the rustling of wings. It was like witnessing a hive bustling with bees during springtime.

Despite the crowd, a signal was given, and the spirits, who once appeared gigantic, shrunk to diminutive sizes, similar to the tales of fairies and elves. Yet, even as many settled, the great lords, the Seraphim and Cherubim, held their majestic forms. They sat in a secluded meeting, surrounded by countless lesser spirits on golden seats. After a brief pause, the momentous council commenced.
