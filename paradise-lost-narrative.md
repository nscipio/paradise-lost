# Paradise Lost
### by John Milton, Adapted by NM Scipione

## Book I

Man's first disobedience, a taste of the forbidden tree, unleashed death and despair, distancing us from Eden. In anticipation, we look to a greater Man for restoration. I call upon the Muse, who once whispered atop Oreb and Sinai, guiding the shepherd to narrate the world's emergence from chaos. If Sion Hill or Siloa's brook, by God's oracle, resonates more with you, from there I seek your guidance. With this grand narrative, aiming to tread uncharted terrains, I implore the Holy Spirit, valuing a pure heart over grand temples, to enlighten and elevate me. My purpose is to grasp and articulate God's ways to Man. Reveal the reason our forebears, favored by Heaven, went against their Creator for one prohibition. Who was their tempter? The serpent, filled with envy and thirst for revenge, misled the mother of all. His pride, after being cast out from Heaven with his rebellious kin, aspired to challenge the Most High, scheming against His divine reign.

<p align="center">•••</p>

First, tell of the reason, hidden neither from Heaven nor Hell, that swayed our forebears in their blessed state to defy their Maker and go against His single command, even as they ruled the world. Who lured them into this dire betrayal? The cunning serpent, driven by envy and vengeance, deceived humanity's mother. His audacity, having led a rebellion against Heaven with a host of fallen angels, aimed to surpass even the Most High. But his insolent war was in vain, as the Almighty cast him down in a fiery descent to endless ruin. Bound in unyielding chains amidst searing flames, he who dared challenge the Omnipotent suffered. For a duration far surpassing mortal understanding, he and his followers languished in a blazing abyss. Amidst his torment, he's tormented by memories of lost bliss and the looming eternity of pain. He beholds his desolate surroundings, a blazing prison offering only a gloomy illumination, revealing only misery. A realm devoid of peace, where relentless torment persists. This abyss, ever ablaze yet unending, was justice's design for the rebels. Far from Heaven's light, they found their dismal fate. Such a stark contrast to their former glory. Among the fallen, Satan recognizes Beelzebub, his equal in power and wickedness. Breaking the stifling silence, Satan, once a revered figure in Heaven, speaks with audacity.

<p align="center">•••</p>

If you are who I think, how you've changed! Once radiant in the realm of light, you outshone countless others. Are you the same ally who shared my hopes and risks in our grand venture? Now we share this dismal fate. Look at the depths we've fallen from. The might of his thunder was unknown until it cast us down. Yet, even transformed and diminished, I don't regret our rebellion. The same resolve that once made me challenge the mightiest remains. Many joined our cause, opposing his rule, leading to a great battle in Heaven that threatened his throne. But even if we lost the battle, we haven't lost everything. My will remains unbroken, fueled by a desire for revenge, eternal enmity, and an unwavering courage. I'll never surrender or admit defeat. He won't strip me of my glory. To kneel and beg for his mercy, after recently challenging his reign, would be a greater shame than our fall. Our divine essence remains intact, and with the knowledge from our past conflict, we can plan our next move with hope. Whether by force or cunning, we'll wage an endless war against our triumphant foe, who now rejoices and rules Heaven.

<p align="center">•••</p>

The fallen angel spoke with defiant pride, even as deep despair tormented him. His audacious counterpart quickly responded.

<p align="center">•••</p>

"O leader of the mighty, you who bravely led us in war against Heaven's eternal ruler, challenging his supreme authority. The sad outcome is clear — our defeat has cost us Heaven. This vast army lies defeated, but our minds and spirits remain unbroken. Though we've lost our glory and joy, we're now mired in endless suffering. If our conqueror, evidently Almighty, has preserved our spirit and strength, is it merely to endure his wrath? Or might we serve him in some greater capacity? But even with our undiminished strength and eternal existence, what good is it if we're doomed to eternal torment?" To this, the arch-fiend quickly responded.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Fallen cherub, weakness brings misery, whether in action or suffering. Yet, know this: doing good will never be our role. Our sole desire is to act against his will, whom we oppose. If he seeks to create good from our evil, our aim is to subvert that intention. Our goal is to turn any good into a means for evil, to possibly disturb his plans. But observe — he's pulled back his punishing forces to Heaven's gates. The storms and lightning that pursued us have ceased their roaring in the vast depths. We must seize this moment, regardless of our foe's intent. Do you see that desolate plain, dark except for the faint glow of these flames? Let's head there, away from these tumultuous fires, to find some solace. There, we can regroup and plan our next move — how to further defy our enemy, recover from our losses, and overcome this disaster. We'll explore any hope, or if none, any determination from our despair.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Satan, head raised above the waters and eyes ablaze, spoke to his closest ally. His vast form sprawled across the expanse, reminiscent of ancient titans or the massive sea creature, Leviathan. Sailors might mistake such a creature for an island, anchoring to its scales. Despite this grandeur, the arch-fiend was bound to the fiery lake. He hadn't moved, except for the allowance of Heaven's overarching will. This freedom was a test, letting him pursue his dark ambitions, seeking harm to others. Yet, his actions only revealed the boundless goodness and mercy of Heaven, especially towards Man, whom Satan had misled. In contrast, Satan only brought more punishment upon himself.

He then rose from the waters, causing the surrounding flames to recede and revealing a daunting valley. With wings spread, he took flight, the air burdened by his presence. Landing on scorched land, it seemed as if the ground itself was aflame, like volcanic eruptions transforming landscapes. Here, Satan found footing. Following him was his comrade, both reveling in their escape from the infernal waters. They attributed their resilience to their strength, dismissing the idea it was by Heaven's grace.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Is this our new domain? The lost archangel questioned, contrasting the bleak darkness with Heaven's radiant glow. If this is the replacement for Heaven's splendor, so be it. The one who rules now determines what's right, elevating whom he pleases. We bid farewell to the joyful realms of Heaven and embrace this infernal world. Yet, in this darkness, I retain a mind unchanged by location or time. Our minds can find Heaven in Hell or Hell in Heaven. Our essence remains, regardless of our surroundings. Isn't it better to rule here in Hell than to be subservient in Heaven? But, why have we left our loyal comrades in their dazed state? Shouldn't they share this realm with us? Perhaps we can strategize a return to Heaven or solidify our reign in Hell.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Satan spoke, and Beelzebub replied, "O leader of the radiant armies, only the Almighty could have defeated us. Your voice, a beacon of hope in our darkest moments, has always rallied us during fierce battles. If they hear you now, they will find new strength, even though they lie defeated on that burning lake. It's no surprise we're in shock, having fallen from such great heights."

<p align="center">•••</p>

Satan, the leading fallen angel, approached the shore. He carried a massive, ethereal shield on his back, so large it resembled the moon in the night sky. His spear was immense, dwarfing the tallest trees. Despite the burning ground under his feet and the intense heat around him, he walked determinedly to the edge of the fiery sea. There, he saw his fallen comrades, strewn about like leaves in autumn, lost and transformed in their new, hellish forms.

Raising his voice, a call that echoed throughout the depths of Hell, he addressed them, "Leaders and warriors, the pride of Heaven, now fallen! Are you so stunned by our fate? Have you chosen to rest here after our battle, or have you surrendered to our conqueror?" He pointed to their scattered weapons and banners, warning them of Heaven's forces that might soon take advantage. "Wake up, stand up, or accept defeat forever."

<p align="center">•••</p>

Upon hearing Satan's call, the fallen angels stirred, hastily rising like startled soldiers caught asleep on duty. They felt the pain of their new reality but were quick to obey their leader's commanding voice. Like a vast swarm of locusts summoned by Moses in Egypt, the demons filled the air, only settling down at Satan's signal.

A myriad of banners, resembling a forest of spears and a vast sea of shields, rose, signaling the assembly of the fallen army. They moved gracefully, their steps orchestrated to the soothing sounds of flutes and pipes, masking the pain of the scorched earth beneath them. As they advanced, they presented a formidable front, waiting for their leader's next command.

Satan, standing tall and still exuding an aura of command, surveyed his troops. Though scars from the battle marred his once radiant face, he emanated a fierce and indomitable spirit. The weight of his rebellion and the sight of his once-glorious comrades, now diminished, visibly pained him. Yet, there was a resolve in his eyes, hinting at plans for revenge.

He attempted to address his vast army several times, struggling with his emotions. Finally, weaving words with heartfelt sighs, he began to speak, and all listened in rapt attention.

<p align="center">•••</p>

My fellow spirits, unmatched in might except by the Almighty, our rebellion was not without honor, even though we now find ourselves in this grim abyss. Could anyone have foreseen such powerful beings facing defeat? Yet, who believes that we, the mighty hosts banished from Heaven, cannot return and reclaim our rightful place? I can vouch that no different counsel or risk-avoidance on my part could have saved our cause. The one who now rules Heaven seemed invincible, relying on his reputation and tradition. His hidden strength tempted our challenge and led to our downfall. Now, we truly understand his power and ours. We should neither provoke nor fear another direct conflict. Instead, we must strategize, using cunning where force failed. Overcoming by force is only a partial victory.

There are rumors of new worlds he plans to create, populated with beings as favored as we once were. Perhaps our first act should be to explore or even invade these places. This hellish prison cannot bind us forever, and we won't remain hidden in this abyss. We must carefully plan our next move. Peace seems unlikely, and who among us can fathom surrender? So, we are left with war, whether declared or covert.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Upon speaking, countless blazing swords, drawn from the powerful Cherubim, surged forth. Their sudden brilliance cast a light throughout the depths of Hell. The rebels, filled with rage against the Highest, clashed their weapons loudly, echoing a challenge that seemed to reach Heaven's very vaults.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Nearby stood a hill, its peak emitting fire and smoke, its surface gleaming, suggesting hidden metallic ores within. Soon, a large brigade hurried there, reminiscent of pioneers preparing for a royal encampment. Mammon, a fallen spirit who, even in Heaven, was obsessed with material wealth, led them. In Heaven, he was more captivated by the golden paths than any divine vision. He was the first to inspire men to mine the Earth for hidden treasures.

Quickly, his team mined the hill, extracting golden veins. It should surprise no one that riches exist in Hell, for perhaps this place is most deserving of such curses. Those who boast of human achievements, like the wonders of Babel, should learn that even their greatest works can be easily surpassed by these fallen spirits.

Near the plains, many others worked, extracting and refining metals from the fiery veins. The metals were then poured into molds, akin to wind flowing through an organ's pipes. Soon, a magnificent structure rose from the ground. Its architecture rivalled even the grandest temples on Earth, with golden decorations throughout. It overshadowed the wonders of Babylon or the grandeur of Egypt's pharaohs.

The masses, in admiration, entered this monument, praising both the structure and its architect, Mammon. He was renowned in Heaven for creating towering structures, where esteemed angels once resided. Even in ancient Greece and Italy, tales of his fall from Heaven were shared. They claimed he was cast down by a furious Jupiter, falling for an entire day, landing on the Aegean island of Lemnos. However, this was a mistaken tale; he had fallen much earlier with the rebel angels. All his architectural prowess did not save him from being cast into Hell.

Soon, winged messengers proclaimed a grand council to be held in Pandaemonium, the capital of Satan and his peers. The call went out, and from every corner, the most esteemed demons arrived in droves. The vast hall, reminiscent of a grandiose battlefield, became crowded, the air filled with the rustling of wings. It was like witnessing a hive bustling with bees during springtime.

Despite the crowd, a signal was given, and the spirits, who once appeared gigantic, shrunk to diminutive sizes, similar to the tales of fairies and elves. Yet, even as many settled, the great lords, the Seraphim and Cherubim, held their majestic forms. They sat in a secluded meeting, surrounded by countless lesser spirits on golden seats. After a brief pause, the momentous council commenced.

## Book 2

Seated upon a throne rivaling the splendors of the East, Satan exuded unparalleled majesty. Elevated by his merits and ambitions, his position was one of dark prominence. Despite the despair of his fall, he was undeterred, aiming even higher in his aspirations. Unyielding in his determination to challenge Heaven, he remained unenlightened by previous failures, with his ambitions laid bare for all to witness.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Gathering his legions, he recognized their indomitable spirit, undimmed by their fall. Refusing to concede Heaven as lost, he envisioned their triumphant resurgence. With their solidified position in Hell, free from envy's shadow, they stood united. While the grandeur of Heaven might entice many, in Hell the focus remained on collective strength and unity. All voices were invited to weigh in on their path to victory.

<p align="center">•••</p>

The celestial beings, though fallen, retained a vigor that couldn't be wholly suppressed. Satan refused to deem Heaven permanently lost, believing that their virtues, when rising from this fall, would shine even more brilliantly. His leadership, established both by divine right and his deeds, solidified his position in Hell, free from the shadows of envy. In this realm, the hierarchy of Heaven, with its potential for envy, was irrelevant. Here, none would covet the topmost position, facing Heaven's fiercest wrath. Yet, in their unity and unwavering faith, they found strength unmatched in Heaven. With this renewed vigor, they sought to reclaim their old dominion, and the pressing matter was their strategy: open warfare or cunning deceit. Satan opened the floor for advice, inviting the wise to voice their counsel.

<p align="center">•••</p>

The silence was broken by Moloc, a king known for his strength and ferocity, now intensified by his despair. He had once hoped to be considered the equal of the Eternal in strength, and his pride was such that he'd rather cease to exist than be deemed lesser. Having lost that aspiration, he also lost all his fears. Unconcerned about God, Hell, or any potential fate worse than those, he spoke his mind with fervent conviction.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Moloc, resolute in his conviction, declared, "Our path is clear: open war. I have no talent for deception, and I see no need for it now. While some may scheme, countless others, armed and ready, wait for the call to action. Are we to remain as exiles, confined in this dark prison, dictated by a tyrant's whims? Our current state cannot be our destiny. I propose we rise with the fury of Hell, turning our anguish into weapons against our tormentor. Let him be met with our fierce resistance, seeing his dominion threatened by our unyielding spirit. Climbing back to Heaven may seem a challenge, but it's essential we remember where we came from. The descent was forced; the ascent is a choice. And if we face him once more, whatever wrath he brings, can it truly be worse than our current torment? If he ends our existence, it might be a mercy compared to endless suffering. But if we are indeed eternal, then we have nothing to lose. We've already shown we can disrupt his sanctuary. Even if we don't claim victory, our defiance is a revenge in itself."

<p align="center">•••</p>

Moloc's stern expression made clear his vengeful intent, suggesting a battle fit only for beings of divine stature. As he settled, Belial rose, his demeanor more graceful and composed. No one more handsome was cast out from Heaven. He exuded an air of authority and capability, but beneath the surface, his sincerity was hollow. His words were sweet and convincing, skilled at turning a weak argument into a compelling one, casting doubt on even the wisest advice. In truth, he was more inclined to mischief than noble endeavors, hesitant in action despite his eloquent speech. With a persuasive tone, he began to speak.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Belial, ever the diplomat, began his retort. "I harbor as much hatred as any here, and would readily advocate for open war. But the arguments presented thus far only amplify my reservations. When even our mightiest, in his call to arms, speaks of it as a path to final oblivion, I pause. What revenge can we truly exact? Heaven is fortified, ever vigilant against our incursions. Even if we were to break through, Heaven would expel us, leaving us in even greater despair. Some argue that nonexistence is preferable to our current suffering. But who among us wishes for oblivion over existence, no matter the torment? And even if that was our collective desire, would our adversary grant it? Or would he, in his infinite wisdom, deny us that respite?"

He continued, "Our past attempts to escape our plight have only led to greater suffering. Heaven has a vast arsenal of torments it could unleash upon us. Should we risk even greater wrath? Regardless of whether we wage open war or employ subterfuge, both seem doomed against an all-seeing enemy. He mocks our every plan. So, where does that leave us? Do we simply accept our eternal torment? Even if this is our fate, time might lessen the severity of our punishment. This place could become more bearable. With eternity ahead, unforeseen opportunities might emerge. Our current lot, though grim, could be far worse. We must proceed with caution."

<p align="center">•••</p>

Belial, masking his intentions with seemingly logical words, championed a false tranquility and idleness, mistaking them for genuine peace. Mammon then took the floor.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Mammon began, "Our choices are clear: challenge Heaven's King or retrieve our lost standing. Yet, the notion of displacing him rests on the uncertain chance that the eternal Father might succumb to unpredictable fate. Both seem improbable. How could we claim a place in Heaven without defeating its Supreme Ruler? If he were to extend a hand of mercy, how could we, in good conscience, stand humbly before him, compelled to extol a leader we loathe, all while he reigns, surrounded by heavenly fragrances and tributes?

Would a lifetime of reluctant reverence be our fate? Such a role in Heaven feels more constraining than our present liberty in this expansive void. Here, we are our own masters, beholden to none, valuing hard-earned freedom over gilded servitude. Our resilience will be evident when we rise amidst challenges, finding solace amidst suffering, and prospering under the most trying circumstances.

Why does this shadowed domain instill fear? The sovereign of Heaven often dwells amidst dense clouds and obscurity, his throne emanating power, resembling our very Hell. Can't we mirror his luminance in our own manner? This desolate realm conceals riches, and we hold the expertise to unearth its splendor. With time, our torments might ease, as we acclimate and evolve, lessening our anguish.

All evidence suggests a pursuit of harmony and stability. Reflecting upon our history and present, warfare seems ill-advised. I urge this: center on our collective welfare and exercise control over our destiny."

<p align="center">•••</p>

After Mammon concluded, the assembly resonated with murmurs, much like the lingering sounds in deep caverns post a tumultuous storm. Such murmurs were akin to weary sailors, soothed by the storm's aftermath, finding solace in a sheltered bay. Their applause for Mammon's plea for peace was palpable. Memories of thunder and the looming threat of Michael's blade evoked a fear more profound than their infernal exile. Despite this, aspirations for an empire beneath, rivaling Heaven, persisted.

In the midst of this, Beelzebub, only surpassed by Satan in authority, stood up. He radiated leadership; his visage, though scarred, reflected profound wisdom and once-regal authority. Towering and regal, he seemed built to bear the weight of mighty realms. The assembly's gaze fixed upon him in anticipation as he prepared to address them.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Beelzebub began, "We were once mighty thrones of Heaven, but are we now content as 'Princes of Hell'? Many seem keen to establish dominion here. But let's not forget: Heaven's King has deemed this our prison. His reign is inescapable, both in Heaven and Hell.

Why discuss peace or war? We've tasted defeat. No peace is on the horizon, only further chastisement. Any resistance we muster will aim to make our conqueror feel our pain.

Yet, there's talk of another realm, inhabited by a race called 'Man', lesser beings, but cherished by God. He's vowed to birth them. Our focus should pivot there, understanding their nature, their vulnerabilities. Though Heaven stands sealed, this new world could be exposed. We might devastate or dominate it, turning its dwellers against their God, plunging them into regret. Such an act would unsettle God's contentment, amplifying our own.

Should we embark on this venture or languish here, nursing futile dreams? This sinister notion undoubtedly sprang from Satan. A scheme to intertwine Earth with Hell, all to vex the Creator. This rebellion, however, might amplify His splendor. The assembly, captivated by this bold proposition, showed unanimous approval. With this momentum, Beelzebub proceeded.

<p align="center">•••</p>

You have judged wisely, divine assembly, concluding our lengthy debate with a resolution befitting your stature. This decision might elevate us from the depths, bringing us closer to our original abode. We may even glimpse the radiant borders of Heaven and, with a timely effort, perhaps re-enter it. Alternatively, we might find a gentler region, where Heaven's light might touch us again, allowing us to dispel our gloom. There, the soothing air will heal the wounds of these burning fires.

But now the pressing question: Who should we send to discover this new world? Who is brave enough to traverse the vast, shadowed abyss, to find his way through the tangible darkness, or fly tirelessly over the immense void to reach that desired land? And once there, who possesses the strength or wit to evade the vigilant angelic guards?

Such a mission demands utmost caution. Our choice is crucial, for our final hope rests upon the shoulders of our chosen envoy.

<p align="center">•••</p>

After speaking, he sat, his gaze filled with anticipation, waiting to see who would support, oppose, or undertake the risky mission. Yet all remained silent, deeply contemplating the peril. They saw their own fears reflected in the eyes of their comrades, stunned. Among these mighty warriors, none had the courage to volunteer for the daunting task. Finally, Satan, elevated by newfound glory and filled with regal pride, aware of his unmatched stature, spoke without hesitation.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Satan began, "Descendants of Heaven, our silence is warranted. The path from Hell to light is treacherous. Our fiery prison, with its blazing walls and unyielding gates, confines us. Beyond these barriers, an abyss of darkness awaits the daring. For those who escape, unfamiliar realms hold unknown perils.

Yet, why claim this throne and its power if challenges could deter me? Why embrace this title if not ready to face its inherent dangers? As the highest seated, greater risks are mine to bear. So, mighty beings, stay vigilant against our constant foe. I will scour this realm's darkest corners for our salvation, embarking on this quest alone."

As he stood, none opposed. Rising in unison, their ascent echoed like distant thunder. With deep reverence, they praised Satan, elevating him to the stature of Heaven's mightiest. They lauded his sacrifice, a reminder that even the damned possess virtue. These virtues surface when Earth glorifies wicked deeds or masks ambition with feigned piety.

They hailed their unmatched leader, reminiscent of when, post-storm, sunlight pierces the gloom, revitalizing the land, making birds sing and herds rejoice.

However, it's a testament to man's fallibility that while demons find unity, humans, even with divine grace, remain divided. They wage wars, ravaging Earth and each other. Perhaps they forget the infernal enemies already plotting their doom.

<p align="center">•••</p>

After the infernal council concluded, the demonic lords departed in order. At the center was Satan, their paramount leader. He appeared as the sole challenger of Heaven, embodying the grandeur of Hell's emperor, surrounded by a fiery entourage of seraphim, their weapons drawn.

A regal trumpet sounded, signaling the council's end. Four cherubim then broadcasted the decision across Hell, with the vast host responding in a deafening roar of approval. Their spirits somewhat lifted by false hope, the demons dispersed, each seeking solace or distraction from their torment until their leader's return.

Some raced through the plains or took to the skies, evoking images of ancient Olympic or Pythian games. Others rode on their fiery steeds or marched in formation, resembling armies preparing for celestial battles.

A few, driven by intense rage, tore through the land, causing chaos and upheaval. Yet others, more contemplative, retreated to quiet valleys, singing songs of their heroic deeds and lamenting their fall. Their melodies, though biased, were so captivating that they momentarily suspended Hell's torment.

A group, seeking deeper insights, discussed profound topics like fate, free will, and divine foreknowledge, wandering in endless philosophical mazes. Meanwhile, another faction, driven by the urge to explore, embarked on a journey across Hell's dreaded rivers—Styx, Acheron, Cocytus, Phlegeton, and the memory-erasing waters of Lethe.

This bleak realm, filled with snow, ice, and perpetual storms, was reminiscent of cursed landscapes where entire armies were swallowed whole. Here, the damned experienced extremes of fiery and freezing punishments, their souls yearning for even a brief respite. Yet, they were denied even a drop from the Lethe, guarded fiercely by Medusa, reminding one of Tantalus's eternal thirst.

As these damned souls roamed, they encountered sights more horrific than any myth—Gorgons, Hydras, and Chimeras. Their journey through this universe of death, created from divine curse, was a testament to the perversity of nature in Hell.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Driven by grand intentions, Satan, the adversary of both God and humanity, took to the skies with swift wings, heading for Hell's gates. His flight, graceful yet purposeful, was reminiscent of distant ships cutting through vast seas.

As he drew closer, Hell's towering gates loomed. Nine layers strong—brass, iron, and unyielding adamantine rock—they were encased in relentless flames. Two figures stood guard: to one side, a creature, part woman, part serpent, circled by hellhounds whose barks echoed ceaselessly; its presence was more fearsome than tales of Scylla or the eerie hags of the night. Opposite sat a shadowy form, so nebulous it was almost shapeless, yet exuding a dark power, crowned and armed.

Approaching, Satan found the shadow advancing, each step resonating through Hell. Unfazed, for he feared none save God and His Son, Satan gazed upon the creature, curiosity burning in his eyes, ready to converse.

<p align="center">•••</p>

"Who are you, vile creature, to block my path to those gates? Know this, I intend to pass through without your permission. Step aside, or learn the hard way not to challenge the spirits of Heaven."

<p align="center">•••</p>

In response to Satan's declaration, Chaos—the ancient Anarch embodying cosmic disorder—spoke with a faltering voice and an unsettled demeanor. 'I recognize you, the archangel who recently dared to defy the King of Heaven, only to be vanquished. The cacophony of your defeat reverberated even in these depths, followed by Heaven's legions in their relentless pursuit. I hold dominion over this chaotic frontier, a realm continually weakened by internal strife, thereby diminishing the ancient power of Night. Hell was your first prison, and now another world dangles above my domain, linked to the very Heaven you were expelled from by a golden chain. If you seek passage to this new realm, the path is perilous but short. Proceed, for your journey of devastation serves my ends.

<p align="center">•••</p>

Satan, invigorated by the prospect of finally reaching a destination, vaults upwards, cutting through the tumultuous elements that surround him. His journey is arduous, evoking the dangers faced by the Argonauts in the Bosporus and Ulysses navigating past Charybdis. Yet he perseveres, and once he breaks through, the path behind him strangely smooths over, as if by divine intent, allowing Sin and Death easier passage. This bridge extends from Hell to the edge of Earth, a gateway for malevolent spirits to tempt or torment humanity—except those shielded by divine grace.

At last, the faintest hint of light emerges, signifying the boundaries of Nature and the retreat of Chaos. The tumult lessens, and Satan glides more effortlessly through the now calmer abyss. Though battered like a storm-worn ship reaching port, he finally beholds the radiant expanse of Heaven—his former home, now a bitter reminder of his fall. This celestial realm, adorned with opal towers and living sapphire, hangs adjacent to Earth, which itself appears as a small star near the Moon. Fueled by vengeful purpose, Satan hastens towards it, accursed and moving under an ill-fated sky.
