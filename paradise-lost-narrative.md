In the beginning, man's first act of disobedience was to taste the fruit of the forbidden tree. This mortal taste brought death and all our suffering into the world, along with the loss of Eden. But there is hope that one greater Man, Jesus Christ, will restore us and regain our blissful seat in paradise.

I call upon the heavenly Muse to sing this story, the same divine inspiration that once touched the secret peaks of Oreb and Sinai and inspired Moses, the shepherd who first taught the chosen people. It was Moses who explained how the heavens and Earth rose out of chaos. If the Muse prefers, I will invoke the inspiration of Sion Hill or the flowing brook of Siloa, near the Oracle of God, to aid my adventurous song.

My intention is to soar above the traditional poetic realms, pursuing themes unattempted in prose or rhyme. I appeal especially to you, Holy Spirit, who values purity and righteousness above all earthly temples. Instruct me, for you know all things, and you were present from the beginning with mighty wings outspread, like a dove brooding over the vast abyss, making it pregnant with creation.

Enlighten what is dark in me, raise what is low, and support my efforts so that I may assert God's eternal providence. Through this great argument, I seek to justify the ways of God to men.
