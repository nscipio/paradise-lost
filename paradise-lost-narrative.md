## Book 1

In the beginning, man's first act of disobedience was to taste the fruit of the forbidden tree. This mortal taste brought death and all our suffering into the world, along with the loss of Eden. But there is hope that one greater Man, Jesus Christ, will restore us and regain our blissful seat in paradise.

I call upon the heavenly Muse to sing this story, the same divine inspiration that once touched the secret peaks of Oreb and Sinai and inspired Moses, the shepherd who first taught the chosen people. It was Moses who explained how the heavens and Earth rose out of chaos. If the Muse prefers, I will invoke the inspiration of Sion Hill or the flowing brook of Siloa, near the Oracle of God, to aid my adventurous song.

My intention is to soar above the traditional poetic realms, pursuing themes unattempted in prose or rhyme. I appeal especially to you, Holy Spirit, who values purity and righteousness above all earthly temples. Instruct me, for you know all things, and you were present from the beginning with mighty wings outspread, like a dove brooding over the vast abyss, making it pregnant with creation.

Enlighten what is dark in me, raise what is low, and support my efforts so that I may assert God's eternal providence. Through this great argument, I seek to justify the ways of God to men.

Tell me, for Heaven hides nothing from your view, not even the deep tract of Hell, what cause moved our grandparents, Adam and Eve, who were in such a happy state and so highly favored by Heaven, to fall away from their Creator? Why did they transgress His will for just one restriction when they were lords of the rest of the world? Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?

It was the infernal serpent, Satan, whose guile, stirred up by envy and revenge, deceived the mother of mankind. His pride had cast him out from Heaven, along with his host of rebel angels. With their help, he aspired to set himself in glory above his peers and hoped to have equaled the Most High, if he opposed Him. With ambitious aims, he raised an impious war against the throne and monarchy of God in Heaven, proud in battle, but with vain attempt.

The Almighty Power hurled him headlong, flaming from the ethereal sky, with hideous ruin and combustion, down to bottomless perdition. There he was to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire for daring to defy the Omnipotent to arms.

For nine times the space that measures day and night to mortal men, he lay vanquished with his horrid crew, rolling in the fiery gulf, confounded, though immortal. But his doom reserved him for more wrath. Tormented by thoughts of lost happiness and lasting pain, he threw around his baleful eyes, witnessing huge affliction and dismay, mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate.

As far as angels can see, he viewed the dismal, waste, and wild dungeon, flamed like a great furnace. Yet from those flames came no light, only darkness visible, serving only to reveal sights of woe, regions of sorrow, and doleful shades where peace and rest can never dwell. Hope never comes to this place, only endless torture, and a fiery deluge fed with ever-burning sulfur unconsumed.

Eternal Justice had prepared such a place for the rebellious. Their prison was ordained in utter darkness, their portion set as far removed from God and the light of Heaven as from the center thrice to the utmost pole. How unlike the place from whence they fell!

There, Satan soon discerned the companions of his fall, overwhelmed with floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire. Weltering by his side was one next to him in power and crime, long afterward known in Palestine and named Beelzebub.

To Beelzebub, the arch-enemy, then in Heaven called Satan, boldly broke the horrid silence and thus began to speak.

If you are indeed the one I know, how you have fallen! How changed you are from the being who once shone with transcendent brightness in the happy realms of light, outshining myriads of bright beings. If you are he who once joined me in mutual agreement, united in thoughts, counsels, and hopes, and shared the risk in our glorious enterprise, now misery has joined us in equal ruin. Look into what pit we've fallen from such heights! God's thunder has proven so much stronger.

Yet, despite knowing the force of His dire arms, I do not repent or change, though my outward appearance has changed. My fixed mind and high disdain, arising from a sense of injured merit, raised me to contend with the mightiest. I brought along an innumerable force of armed spirits that dared to oppose His reign, preferring me. We opposed His utmost power with our adverse power in a dubious battle on the plains of Heaven, shaking His throne.

What though we have lost the field? All is not lost. We still possess the unconquerable will, the study of revenge, immortal hate, and courage never to submit or yield. We won't be overcome. That glory will never be extorted from me by His wrath or might. To bow and beg for grace, to deify His power—He who so recently doubted His empire because of our force—would be low indeed, an ignominy and shame beneath our downfall.

Since the strength of gods and this celestial substance cannot fail, and since we've learned from this great event and advanced in foresight, we may now resolve with more successful hope to wage an eternal war, irreconcilable, against our grand foe. He now triumphs, and in his excess of joy, he alone holds the tyranny of Heaven.

Thus spoke the apostate angel, although in pain, boasting aloud but racked with deep despair. His bold comrade soon answered him.
